## 2. Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

Any contribution is greatly appreciated


 <a name=tests></a>
## 7. Tests

Run: node index.js

The easiest way to test is to follow the prompts, answer the questions, they are pretty straight forward, basically the program asks for the inputs and combines with the setup lines within the code and generates a text file.  The text file will include HTML commands that will not be shown in a web browser showing the README.md file or Github repository.
